# Graphics-rendering

## Graphics related mini projects

All mini-projects are built using processing3 language.
Please Note: When running the code, there are hot keys that can change output of the program, see "modes" to know which key does what operation.

### 1. Showing different lighting and shading models on a sphere.

- In processing, spheres can be drawn using a mathematical formula and can be filled using connected but not overlapping triangles or polygons. 
- Lighting models include flat, and PHONG_Face and PHONG_Vertex models.
- Shading models include BARYCENTRIC, FLAT, GOURAUD, PHONG
- The goal of this program was to observe the effect of different lighting and shading models on the quality of the rendered graphic. 

### 2. Graphics Rendering pipeline

- In processing, we can access the matrices involved in the graphics rendering pipeline which include the Projection, world, camera, viewport, and model matrix. 
- These matrices can be modified by multiplying them with desired transform matrices such as rotate, scale and translate matrices.
- The purpose of this mini-program was to understand the low-level implementations of a graphics rendering pipeline.

### 3. 2D and 3D basic game

- In processing, we can manipulate the projection matrix to switch between 2D to 3D view without having to modify any of the objects being rendered.
- The game is a basic game with a floor and some obstacles and basic physics model movements.
- The main purpose of this game was to be able to incorporate various textures and use linear and non-liner interpolation to do Frame-based and geometry-based animation as the character moves.
